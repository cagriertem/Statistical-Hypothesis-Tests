# Statistical-Hypothesis-Tests
The project includes Feature Selection by Statistical Hypothesis Tests and Making Prediction Based On Selected Features

In this project, we will try to use statistical hypothesis tests on "Costumer Personality Analysis" dataset.

Firstly, we will preprocess our data, combine some columns and investigate the data in general.

The second part will be about using statistical hypothesis tests such as "Normality Test" to see whether the data have normal distribution or not, and nonparametric statistical hypothesis tests such as Spearman's Rank Correlation Test. That is to say, the second part will mainly be about feature selection based on statistical tests.

Lastly, we will use the features selected by statistical hypothesis tests to predict the outcome (dependent) data. We will compare different prediction algorithms by using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R2 scores.
